Our team reviewed data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics and pulled airline data spanning the years 2019 - 2021. We reviewed passenger count, aggregate ticket prices by year, most popular geographies, and busiest flight routes (based on passenger count). We also took a look at vaccination data that correlated with an increase in flight travel over the course of 2020 - 21.
